  Given the requirements, I will outline some example tasks for the Backend Sprint Backlog in Swift:

1. Implement basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) (Task)
   - Create addition function: `func add(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -> Double`
   - Create subtraction function: `func subtract(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -> Double`
   - Create multiplication function: `func multiply(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -> Double`
   - Create division function: `func divide(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) throws -> Double`

2. Save calculation history (Task)
   - Create CalculationHistory class with properties for calculation details
   - Implement save method to store instances of the CalculationHistory class

3. Load and display calculation history (Task)
   - Create a function to load saved calculation history
   - Display loaded calculations in an appropriate format

4. Ensure sub-second response time for operations (Task)
   - Optimize functions for efficient execution

5. Implement security measures as per mobile device standards (Task)
   - Incorporate encryption for sensitive data
   - Validate input data before processing
   - Consider secure authentication and authorization mechanisms if needed

6. Implement privacy controls as per mobile device standards (Task)
   - Include an opt-out feature for users who do not want their calculation history stored
   - Ensure that no personal information is being collected or shared without explicit user consent
