**Sprint Backlog:**
1. Frontend Sprint Backlog:
   - Design and implement input fields for numbers (Task)
   - Implement operation selection functionality (Task)
   - Display result of calculations (Task)
   - Design and implement easy navigation layout (Task)
   - Implement accessibility features for visually impaired users (Task)

2. Backend Sprint Backlog:
   - Implement Android compatibility (Task)
   - Implement iOS compatibility (Task)
   - Implement basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) (Task)
   - Save calculation history (Task)
   - Load and display calculation history (Task)

Each task will be explicitly linked to the corresponding user story or element of the product owner's definition. The tasks will be coded in JavaScript and Swift for frontend and backend respectively, ensuring coherence with the nature of each task (front or back). The tasks will also adhere to the given criteria of clarity, specificity, and deliverable code format.
